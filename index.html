    <h2>WRITING TASK 2</h2>



    <h5>Some people think money is the best gift to give it to youngsters, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
    </h5>


    <p>In the contemporary world, it is a piece of tradition for some people giving a money instead of gift, while other people consider it a piece of reason why most kids being spoiled. After pondreing this phenomenon, in my mind it is a common thing and this essay will additiate some ideas to this trand. <br> <br>
        To start with, some people regard encouraging teens financially is the optimum way for everyone. The primary reasonis that it is very challenging when it comes to opt an appropriate gift for kid's wishes. Most of the relatives such as uncles, aunts or nephew find it difficult to sift the millions of options in market in order to find something special. That is why, filling their pocket with an adequate amout of sum makes them euphoric becouse they can buy everything they wish or save it for their future difficulties. <br><br>
        On the other hand, most human beings reckoned to think that money can spoil kid's morality in most cases. For instance, children have not as much knowladge as seniors do, thus they might fritter their money buying the things that not age appropriate or hazardous. In addition, some of these teenagers may develop bad habits such as smoking and doing drugs, simply becouse they have enough to purchase whatever they want. Hence, with the best wishes in mind, most of the parents try to know what exactly children want, and purchase them as much as they afford financially. <br><br>
        To conclude, relatives better act accordingly youngsters' preferings wheather giving presents or cash. In my mind, equipping children with gifts is more surprising as it is the key feature of most birthday parties or gatherings.
